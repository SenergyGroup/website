  content: "*Clean Energy*: In the United States, the average starting cost to install a 6-kW solar system for a home is $15,000. We believe that is too much. Clean energy shouldnâ€™t be treated as a luxury, and we are committed to providing our community with affordable products so everyone can have access to a renewable power source. <br>
  *Environmental Projects*: This year, the NOAA announced that the "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico has grown to approximately 6,334 square miles. That is more than 4 million acres of habitat unavailable to marine life because of pollution. We pledge to find ways to limit the "dead zone" without putting the burden on hard working farmers."
